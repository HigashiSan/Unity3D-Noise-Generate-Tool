# Unity3D-Noise-Generate-Tool
This is an editor tool to generate various noise in Unity.And the noise type can be added in the compute shader.The noise texture generated can be saved in your designated file.

Just put the NoiseGenTool.cs in the Editor file, and the default savepath of the noisetexture is the asset file, which you can modify bu yourself.

Later I will add more noise types as well as a 3D noise texture option.
